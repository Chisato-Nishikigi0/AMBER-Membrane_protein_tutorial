# AMBER-Membrane_protein_tutorial

*Disclaimer: I hope this tutorial will be useful to others wishing to run molecular dynamics simulations of membrane proteins with AMBER. However, it is as much for my own reference as a guide to others. There are a number of ways to construct such systems for AMBER, including but not limited to: AMBAT, charmm-gui, DABBLE. In this case, we use the recently released PACKMOL-Memgen: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00269*
